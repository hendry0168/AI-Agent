🧠 Project Summary: VERA – Virtual Evaluator for Returns & Assets

I'm building a modular AI-powered financial assistant named VERA to help manage my entire financial life. VERA will handle everything from budgeting and retirement planning to investments, risk analysis, and financial goal tracking.
________________________________________
🌱 Core Responsibilities of VERA
1. Retirement Simulation

•	I invest $100/month, increasing the amount by y% every year.

•	The portfolio grows at an average annual return of x%.

•	VERA will simulate 30 years of growth and compare the future investment income to my living expenses (currently $30,000/year, growing at 2% inflation).

•	Goal: See if I can live off investment income alone, without touching the principal.


2. If Retirement Goal Isn’t Met:

•	Recommend a higher return rate (x%) using more aggressive investment strategies 

•	Suggest a better investment growth rate (y%) by increasing monthly contributions
________________________________________
🧩 Design Goals

•	Modular and scalable  – Designed to grow from a simple retirement calculator to a full-fledged AI trading & wealth management system.

•	Adaptive – Learns from financial trends and user behavior to improve recommendations.

•	Automated – Runs simulations, executes trades, and tracks spending with minimal manual input.

🔄 Additional Features (Coming Soon)

•	Risk tolerance assessment

•	Personalized asset allocation

•	Swing trading tools to increase returns

•	Financial journaling and spending tracker

•	Monte Carlo simulations for stress-testing the portfolio

•	Tax impact modeling (e.g., capital gains, dividends)

•	Healthcare inflation tracking
________________________________________
⚙️ Technical Foundation

•	Language & IDE: Python, coded in VS Code

•	Key APIs:

o	OpenAI – smart decision-making & insights

o	Plaid – connect to banking data

o	Notion API – logging results or tasks

o	Motion – task planning (via integrations or workarounds)

•	Database:

o	PostgreSQL for structured storage

o	Redis for fast memory caching + Pub/Sub for agent messaging (real-time alerts)

•	Deployment & Infrastructure:

o	Docker for containerization + packaging

o	Kubernetes (AWS EKS / GKE) for orchestration + scaling

o	gRPC → Direct phone calls between agents.

o	Prometheus + Grafana → Shared notebook(metric) for all agent actions.

•	Automation & Scheduling:

o	Apache Airflow to run recurring agent tasks like daily market checks

•	Testing & Monitoring:

o	Local sandbox for testing strategies

o	Health checks to ensure agents run properly

o	Clear interfaces for long-term scalability

# 🧠 VERA – Virtual Evaluator for Returns & Assets

*Modular AI Financial Assistant for Building, Preserving & Growing Wealth*

---

## 🌱 Core Responsibilities of VERA

### 1. Retirement Simulation
- Monthly investment: **$100**, increasing by **y% annually**
- Portfolio grows at **x% average annual return**
- VERA simulates **30 years of growth** and compares investment income against future living expenses (currently **$30,000/year** in Singapore, adjusted by **2% inflation**)

**Goal:** Determine if investment income alone can cover future expenses without touching the principal.

### 2. If Retirement Goal Isn’t Met:
- Recommend a higher return rate (x%) using more aggressive strategies
- Suggest a higher investment growth rate (y%) by increasing monthly contributions
